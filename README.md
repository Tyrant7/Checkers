# Checkers!
An open source checkers engine for the console implemented in C++.

## A Few Thoughts
Don't mind the clunky controls, or messy code. This was my first real C++ project and was meant entirely to help me learn. If you end up learning something or finding my code interesting, that's great! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements to my code, that's great too and I'll be glad to hear about it. Overall this was just a fun learning experience to get me using C++ and I thought I might as well put it up on Github for others to see.
